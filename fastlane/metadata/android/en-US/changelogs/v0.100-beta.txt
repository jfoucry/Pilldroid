# beta-0.100 – First public release

**REMENBER** Pilldroid is a French people user only.

I made a lot a tests but there must stay some bugs.

## What is not working
- QR-code scan on a dark background. The library I use does not
find the code.

## What is not implemented
- removing of a prescription from the list;
- take prescription reminder. It will be never been implemented (by me).

**ATTENTION**, Pilldroid does not manage creams, liquids
(like insulin).

Thanks to use [github](https://github/jfoucry/pilldroid) for bugs
reports and new features.

> I made Pilldroid on my free time which is not expandable. Please
do not stress me it will be unproductive.
